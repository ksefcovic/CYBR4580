# Progress Report (Tuesday, December 17th)
## Overview
We have been quite busy since Milestone 2. We have created a demo of our environment from the beginning to the end of the user lifecycle. Additionally, we have taken steps to secure our environment so that we can keep any would-be users' information safe.



## Outcomes

For an in-depth look at what took place each week, follow [this link](https://github.com/ksefcovic/CYBR4580/blob/master/ProgressReports.md) to our weekly progress reports

* Successfully engineered the AOSP to allow for the sending of information from a test device to the web environment.
* Created a phone application that allows users to authenticate using a randomly generated string of numbers.
* Sent location information from test device to the web environment.
* Performed a security evaluation to find vulnerabilities and leaked user information.
* Worked to remediate those issues by securing the web environment using an SSL certificate and applying security patches.
* Attempted to make the user interface as pleasing as possible.  


## Hinderances
* Worked with devices and frameworks that we havenâ€™t before.
* We ran into hardware restrictions compiling the AOSP where we needed a very powerful machine.
* Spent time troubleshooting sending and receiving location information.
* Problem with updating threads on the Device Registration application
